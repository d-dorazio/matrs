## New Art

- Random epicycles drawing. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferent_and_epicycle and https://youtu.be/qS4H6PEcCCA
- draw lines from particles movement in a particles system
- Photographic mosaic(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_mosaic)
- fractal flames(http://flam3.com/flame.pdf); looks so complex though
- Add A visualization For the Golden ratio. The usual One with rectangles retrieved from the Fibonacci sequenze with the curve drawn is cool enough https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_spiral

## Improvements

- color: extract color gradient generation away from voronoi
- delaunay: draw triangulation on gradient like for voronoi.
- cli: allow colors to be passed from the cli. This could be eased by the RandomColorConfig struct.
- primirs: add parallelism
- voronoi: add parallelism
- dragons:  use  a form of noise to provide more randomness

## In Progress
